# gzDoom_launcher
An attempt to rewrite tclgz_launcher in python. </br>
<p>
It's a launcher that makes easy to run GZDoom designed maps, games, mods, etc... it's not meant to be original or the best out there, but it works, it's fast to set up and start playing.
</p>
<p>
After first setup (Files -> Reset to default or clicking yes on first launch) you will have some doom engine games, mods and a lot of megawads. I choose then based on this thread https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/93734-doomworld-community-top-wads-of-all-time/. It's not the same as top 15 megawads since I included other megawads and choose to not include others. I included 2 heretic Megawads to play with Blasphemer.
</p>
<p>
I don't fallow any strict programing rules, I make this for hobby. It's fun to code in python and that's why I made this, I don't want to make a lot of code comments, documents, etc... I just want to relax and take my mind away from work while doing this. I was a Delphi developer, python is powerful and easy giving me the same feeling as before. I was missing that feeling.
