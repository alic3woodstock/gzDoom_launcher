# gzDoom_launcher
An attempt to rewrite tclgz_launcher in python. </br>
<p>
It's a launcher that makes easy to run gzdooom designed maps, games, mods, etc... it's not meant to be original or the best out there, but it works and it's fast to set up and start playing.
</p>
<p>
To configure click on Files -> Download and when it finishes click on Files -> Extract to place all files in the right place and create the database. After that you will have some doom engine games, mods and a lot of map sets. I choose then based on a forum thread that discuss what doom wads are most fun to play. I will place the link here when I remember where I found this form treahd.

I don't fallow any strict programing rules, I make this for hobby. It's fun to code in python and that's why I made this, I don't wanna make a lot of code comments, docments, etc... I just want to relax and take my mind away from work while doing this. I was a Delphi developer, python is powerful and easy giving me the same feeling as before. I was missing that feeling.
